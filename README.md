### Project Title
Udacity Python Project: Interactive display of bikeshare data

### Description
This is a project created during the Udacity Nanodegree course "Programming for
Data Science with Python".
It uses data from a US bikeshare company and displays them, depending on user
input entered via the terminal. The user can choose data from three cities and
filter by month and/or day.
The output is some basic descriptive statistics on the data as well as raw data.
